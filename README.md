# Financial Risk Analysis with Python

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of a simulated Financial Data Analyst internship at Goldman Sachs. The objective is to analyze customer transactional behavior, evaluate account performance, and identify potential financial risks using Python-based data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## 🧩 Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Data Cleaning and Formatting
- Removed special characters from financial fields  
- Converted currency columns into numerical format  
- Validated and formatted date columns  
- Standardized account types and transaction categories  
- Treated missing and inconsistent entries

---

### Task 2: Descriptive Transactional Analysis
- Calculated monthly and yearly summaries of:
  - Total Credits  
  - Total Debits  
  - Net Transaction Volume  
- Plotted trends of debit vs credit transactions  
- Identified top and bottom performing accounts  
- Flagged dormant or inactive accounts based on transaction gaps

---

### Task 3: Customer Profile Building
- Segmented customers into activity levels:
  - High  
  - Medium  
  - Low  
- Grouped accounts by:
  - Average Balance  
  - Transaction Volume  
- Created profiles for:
  - High-net inflow accounts  
  - High-frequency low-balance accounts  
  - Negative or near-zero balance accounts

---

### Task 4: Financial Risk Identification
- Tracked accounts with frequent large withdrawals  
- Measured balance volatility using standard deviation  
- Detected anomalies using:
  - IQR method  
  - Z-score method  
- Highlighted customers with irregular transaction behavior

---

### Task 5: Visualisation
- Conducted extensive EDA with attractive and meaningful visualizations  
- Used Matplotlib to present patterns and risk indicators  
- Performed all analysis in Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- Python Programming  
- Pandas for data handling  
- NumPy for numerical computation  
- Matplotlib for visualization
